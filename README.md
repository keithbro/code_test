# Compensation Calculator

## Given more time I would...

* Validate my inputs! Currently the JSON files must be in the correct format
  and if they are not you would probably get an ugly error message.
* Possibly split out calculator.js in to multiple modules, one focused on
  rules, and another focused on people. Might even be worth turning them in to
  proper classes, but I went for a very functional approach instead.
* Move the "scripts" in to their own module so that they can be unit tested.
